# Product Component

## How to get here ?

When a Product card (in ProductItem.js file) is clicked , we get redirected to [slug].js file, to see more details upon it

```js filename="ProductItem.js"  copy
<Link href={`/product/${product.slug}`}>
  <a>
    <h2 className="text-lg">{product.name}</h2>
  </a>
</Link>
```

![Product Screen](/../public/images/slug.png)

So [slug].js file is rendered
![Product screen](/../public/images/ProductScreen.png)
The `ProductScreen` component displays product details and allows users to add the product to their cart

```js filename="[slug].js"  copy

```

Destructuring Props: The product prop is destructured from the props object. This prop likely contains information about the product to be displayed on the screen.

Context API: The useContext hook is used to access the global state and dispatch functions from the Store context. This allows the component to interact with the application's state.

Handling Missing Product: If the product is not available (likely null or undefined), the component renders a message indicating that the product was not found.

addToCartHandler Function: This function is called when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked. It performs the following steps:

It checks if the product already exists in the cart using the existItem variable.
It calculates the quantity to be added to the cart, either incrementing the existing quantity or setting it to 1 if the product is not in the cart.
It checks if the product is in stock by comparing the available stock quantity (product.countInStock) with the desired quantity.
If the product is in stock, it dispatches an action to add the product to the cart using the dispatch function. The action includes the product details and quantity.
