# Fetching Product by Slug

## Get Slug

I need to first find a way to access slug (let's say is we want to get <strong>superbook-pro</strong> product) in URL \
( localhost:3000/Product/superbook-pro ), then i can find the requested product.
![URL Sample](/../public/images/URLSample.png)

## Context

Context is an object used to carry important details like request parameters, headers, and authentication data.\
Here, i use `context.params.slug` to access the 'slug' parameter from the URL

```js showLineNumbers filename="API.js "
async function FetchOneProduct(context) {
  const { params } = context;
  const { slug } = params;
  await db.connect();
  const product = await Product.findOne({ slug }).lean();
  await db.disconnect();
  return {
    props: {
      product: product ? db.convertDocOptToObj(product) : null,
    },
  };
}
```

## Find Product

After connecting to Database is time to fetch \
line5: fetch a single product

- [`findOne({ slug })`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html) It's querying the database to find a single document where the slug field matches the value extracted earlier from the params ( Let's say <strong>superbook-pro </strong> ).
- [`.lean()`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/lean.html) method is used to convert Mongoose documents into plain JavaScript objects

line7: If product exists in database, `db.convertDocOptToObj` converts the left properties (id , createdAt , updatedAt) to plain JavaScript objects.\
then returns products as props to make it available for `ProductScreen` components to handle
